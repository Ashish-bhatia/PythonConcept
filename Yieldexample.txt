What yield helps you to do. 

Yield is as good as return. But it leaves the function in suspended state. 
Yield helps you pick one item and do the processing and than pick up next. 

So with respect to code yieldexample.py you can see when we use for loop and return. we required to process full loop. 
While with yield we do not. Also if we use break, we begins from intial everytime. While yield saves the last state of the loop, 
and continue from there. 

and yield generates a genretor. which have .next() method associated with it. While Return gives you complete list, and it does not support 
.next() method.
